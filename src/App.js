        This whole project started with the very simple desire to automate some of the things in my DND 5e campaign that I thought generative AI could help with. 
            The first iteration of this project generated magic items before chatGPT-3.0 changed the AI landscape. That project eventually led to this one. 
            <br />
            <br />
            
            This version is an image generator for battle maps and a text generator for DND 5e monsters. Despite considerable efforts to make a viable website running ads to fund the compute I could not get a video card for 
            cheap enough to run this project. While the map generator is actually fairly handy the monster generator is not helpful in comparison to current generation LLM. 
            In its current state you can run the models yourself or use google collab to run it.
